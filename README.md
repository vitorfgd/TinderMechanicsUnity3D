# TinderMechanicsUnity3D

A simple Unity application. I'm trying to recreate the basic tinder mechanics. **Work in progress**


## Create your on cards.

Creating your own cards and game is really simple, create the cards (in the future this will be automatic), create a prefab with that card. Add it to the array under `_CardController` GameObject on the hierarchy root and set how many cards would you like to be instantiated on game start.
